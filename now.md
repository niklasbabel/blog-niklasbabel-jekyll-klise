why now?

think of it as:
> **“what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.”**

here’s what i’m up to now, in no particular order:

* shaping berlin cuisine
* learning to say no (say *no* more often, simple, right?)
* do several rides per week.wait ’till ride opens again.
* boulder regularly with my friends or by myself – 1x a week at least
* functional training in the park 2x /week
